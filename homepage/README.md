# Cricket Score-Predictor and Analysis 
Hi,
  I am Anil Rode from solapur i have done my master degree in FAMT college Ratanagri with aggregated 75% also i have done my Grudation in B.Sc(computer Science) in Solapur University with aggreagetd 89%.

- This is just another simple yet intresting project which can approximately predict an innings score based on the data from 2021 IPL season.  
- I tried training three models:  
 1. Linear Regression  
 2. Lasso  
 3. Ridge 
 4. KNN Algorithm 
- and out of these surprisingly Linear regression was giving more realistic results.  
- If you liked this project star this repo.  
- This project is inspired by a similar project made by Anuj Vyas and tutorial by Krish Naik. 
- Reference by Lern Vern Complected  course,the project and support by FAMT College Rtnagiri.

- I made some improvisations in his code like I totally removed the result page and showed the results on the same page and I am Add more six pages Like IPL,T-20,OneDay scores and display Players To display only users 
- Admin can Add Player and Add Ground in my Website. it is totaly user Friendly  website

- Database use in website  but properly not running  then I  can remove  the database
- And also I took venue as a feature while training as I think that it ca really play a major role in predicting score.  
- Deployed using Flask framework,HTML,CSS,Python,Javascript.  
- Just run app.py and go to localhost to see the results and other way direct open floder in terminal and cmd only floder name~: flask run
